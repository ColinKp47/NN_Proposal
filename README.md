# Project Description
I would like to train neural nets to estimate the nation that is home to a provided image of a city grid. I think there could be a number of interesting applications that could be explored from this kind of model. Perhaps we could explore correlations between similar groupings of grid design and adjusted price-per-mile of public transportation, quality of life or other statistics. I envision a model that groups and identifies city grids from different regions as a starting point, with the hope that the potential applications could be further explored by many creative minds that could think of ways to relate the ways our streets are organized to the ways we live. 

Ultimately, I would like to see a tool like this be used to evaluate and understand current infrastructure while guiding future decisions. 

# Goals
Collect and label large datasets

Explore correlations to link to map datasets

Train model to make inferences about a location based on street grid layout

Explore possible further applications
